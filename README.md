# About 2048

2048 is a strategy game, where the goal is to make a tile of value 2048 by merging tiles with the same value. One can do this by swiping right, left, up or down.

# How to play

Currently this is an early version, where we use the terminal as the interface. The tiles are therefore controlled by a (left), w (up), s (down) and d (right), and one needs to press enter verify the move. 

# God's plan

The further plan is to 
1. Structurate the code better
2. Implement an algorithm based solver
3. Implement a solver based on machine learning, and see if we can win the game in fewer moves than with the "stupid" algorithm.
4. May add interface based on pygames
5. If I find it convenient, I will translate the code to C++ or other languages

Enjoy!
